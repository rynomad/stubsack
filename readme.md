# StubSack

StubSack is a simple workaround that helps people who want to share Substack articles generate links that won't be detected as Substack links, enabling them to bypass Twitter's limitations on tweets containing Substack publication links. This project is easily forked on GitHub, allowing you to create multiple versions with different base URLs.
